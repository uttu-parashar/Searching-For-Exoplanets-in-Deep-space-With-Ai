# Searching-For-Exoplanets-in-Deep-space-With-Ai



* This Project was On the Kepler's Telescope Data. The Data was Numerical , 3k dimensional and Extremely High imbalanced with ratio of 99.7% negative_points & 0.3% Positive Points. And the Task was to classify if there is a exoplanet in orbit of that star or not after giving Intensity Values of Light of That Star.
* After Preprocessing(outlier removing and  Scalling) I Used T-sne to reduce Dimensionality and Visualization of Data. Then I explored various Machine Learning Algorithms Like knn,Liner-Models,Decision Tree, RF on both Imbalanced Train Data And Balanced_Train_Data That i Obtained After Oversampling to Handle Imbalance Problem of Dataset.
* My Best Model Was of Logistic-Regression which gives me Recall-Score of 80% and 89% of AUC on Test Data.
* I have Written Very A detailed Medium blog About the project. And various task Related to it like What is the problem , How We can Solve it Using Ai , How I choose my Main Performance Metric.. Etc.. Please Go through it once to know some points :
